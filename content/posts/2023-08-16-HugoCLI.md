# Why
When working with Hugo, I need some command on the CLI to maintain the blog.

This is what I used:

## Hugo Server
For running the Server locally
```
hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 -b http://ghost-01
```

To include drafts add "--buildDrafts"
```
hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 -b http://ghost-01 --buildDrafts
```


## Hugo New
For new content

```
hugo new [asdjnasd].md
```
